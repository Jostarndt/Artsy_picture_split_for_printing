# Artsy picture split for printing
This project takes a picture and splits it up into several pieces (of adjustable format) to pin them up on a wall in an "instagram design". 
All you need is to enter the format in terms of pictures e.g. (3,10) for 30 pictures in total, as shown in the example, and the size of the corridor inbetween in cm. This is all of simple design purposes. 

## Example
We transform the following picture:

into a bunch of pictures that can be printed in the right format and arranged to:
